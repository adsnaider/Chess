# About
This game is a two player chess. I made it for my final project for the AP Computer Science class in Mountain View High School. I won my school's computer science competition.

# To Compile & Play
"cd" into src. Then run "javac **/*.java && java chessgame.Runner" (Without the quotes). This will bring up the game.
In order to play, you will need to open the game twice. Once both windows are open, check the checkbox which says "Play as server" in one of the windows, and then sign in. A chess board with the pieces should appear. Once you have that, slelect the second login screen and in the textbox write "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" (without the quotes) and press sing in. A chess board with the pieces should appear, and you're set to play.

# Required
In order to compile and run the game, you may have to use java 7 or java 8. I haven't tested compiling the game with java 6 or below.
